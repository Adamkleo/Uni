### Tasks
- [x] EDA
  -  ~~Number of features~~
  -  ~~Number of instances~~
  -  ~~Which variables are categorical/numerical~~
  -  ~~Missing values and which vars have them~~
  -  ~~constant columns~~
  -  ~~regression or classification problem~~
  -  ~~Remove all data not sotavento~~
- [x] Sub-task
  - ~~Analysis of the data~~
- [x] Deciding Inner and Outer Evaluation Techniques
- [x] Scaling Method for KNN
- [x] Testing Models: KNN, regression trees, lienar regression (Normal and Lasso), and SVM
  -  ~~a. Evaluation of the models with default hyperparameters, measure training times~~
  -  ~~b. Adjust their most important hyperparameters and re-evulation and measure training times~~
  -  ~~c. Draw Conclusions:~~
     -  ~~Which is the best moethod?~~
     -  ~~Which of the basic machine learning methods is faster?~~
     -  ~~Are the results better than those of trivial/naive/dummy regressors?~~
     -  ~~Does hyperparameter tuning improve over the default values?~~
     -  ~~Is there a balance between execution time and improvement of results?~~
     -  Is it possible to determine from any technique which attributes are most relevant? 
- [x] Final Model Selection and Evaluation
  -  ~~a. Select the best model based on inner evaluation results. (Waiting to see if it should be KNN or SVM)~~
  -  ~~b. Perform outer evaluation:~~
    -  ~~Estimate future performance on the test set.~~
    -  ~~Compare the final chosen model against a trivial/naive/dummy baseline to ensure improvement.~~
  -  ~~c. Train the final model on the entire dataset.~~
     -  ~~Save the trained model to a file for future use.~~
  -  ~~d. Use the final model to make predictions on the competition dataset.~~
     -  ~~Save these predictions to a CSV file for submission or evaluation.~~
     -  Document and review the entire process and results.
